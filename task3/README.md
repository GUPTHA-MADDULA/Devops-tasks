# 🚀 Terraform Docker Nginx Setup

This project demonstrates how to use **Terraform** with **Docker Desktop** to deploy a simple **Nginx** web server container.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Docker installed and running  
- Terraform installed  

---

## 📌 What This Project Does

- Pulls the latest Nginx image from Docker Hub  
- Creates a Docker container named `nginx_container`  
- Maps port 8080 on your host to port 80 inside the container

## ⚙️ Steps to Run

1. Start Docker Desktop  
2. Login to your Docker registry (if required)  
3. Initialize the Terraform project  
4. Review the execution plan  
5. Apply the configuration to spin up the container

## 🌐 Access the Web Server

After deployment, open your browser and go to:  
**http://localhost:8080**  
You should see the Nginx welcome page.

## 🧹 Destroy the Setup

To remove all created resources, run the destroy command using Terraform.
`terrrafrom destroy auto-approve`

## 📚 Learnings from This Project

- How to provision Docker containers using Terraform  
- Practical use of core Terraform commands: init, plan, apply, destroy  
- Gained experience with infrastructure as code  
- Verified successful deployment by accessing Nginx in the browser
